# Kenney assets

This directory includes some UI assets created by the famous [Kenney](http://kenney.nl/), modified to match LibGDX needs. Note that it does **not** contain a JSON file with predefined style descriptions - but might be useful nonetheless, as you can check available drawables' names in `.atlas` files. This is basically a collection of texture atlases.
